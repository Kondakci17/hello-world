Hey,
My name is Billy but also Gramoz, yeah I have two names, could never really decide which one to choose so some people call me Billy and some people call me Gramoz. Story of my life, either way though I don't care what you call me. I like elephants, tigers, and camels. My favorite times of day are dawn and dusk. I enjoy melancholy, nature hikes, the beach, and basketball. I hate getting strawberry jelly on sweaters and can't think of much else...
